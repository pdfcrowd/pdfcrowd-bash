The Bash client for the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API:
<http://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/>.

The script reads options from ~/.pdfcrowd and then from the command line. You
can store your default options to ~/.pdfcrowd, one option per line:

  $ cat > ~/.pdfcrowd <<!
  > -username username
  > -key apikey
  > -width 210mm
  > -height 297mm
  > !

Now, you can run:

  $ pdfcrowd.sh http://www.google.com > google_com.pdf
  $ pdfcrowd.sh /path/to/local/file > html.pdf
  $ html_producer | pdfcrowd.sh - > file.pdf

On success, the exit status 0 is returned and the result is written to
stdout. Otherwise, a non-zero exit status is returned and the error message is
written to stderr. Run the script with -help to get the list of available
options.
